Hey guys, could you believe that game last night? The Knicks were on fire. Ha, they were doing great until the last quarter, then it was one misstep after another. It was almost painful to watch. Maybe that's their strategy. Keep the opponent off guard and willing to overcome. No kidding. Anyway, moving on to the world we know better. How's your business so far, Jack? Still working on it. I keep hitting a snag with market forecasts. Have you considered contracting a market analyst? They do a pretty good job. Yeah, I've thought about it. I'm just not sure if it's in the budget right now. I need to revisit my funds. Rachel, how about you? How's life post-NBA training been? Surprisingly smooth. The journey seemed daunting at first, but it's starting to make sense now. That's because you're a natural. Have you settled on a specialization yet? I'm leaning towards quantitative finance. It's challenging, but incredibly interesting. Did you guys check out that new exhibit at MoMA? The sculptures? Yeah, they're fabulous. Totally understated. That's an understatement. I mean, a sculpture made out of silicone, kitchen utensils. It's that kind of creative thinking that inspires my work. Breaking the conventional with innovation on my books. Well, as long as your innovative thinking doesn't lead to sculptures made from office supplies, right? Speaking of creative thinking, Anna, how's the book coming along? Oh, it's a never-ending process, Charlotte. I've never rewritten something so much in my life, but I'm pretty happy with how the current draft is shaping up. You know what they say, writing is rewriting. Keep at it, Anna. Agreed. Who knows, the next time we're here, we might be discussing a published book. Really, those designs you send over are excellent. In particular, Charlotte. Thanks, Chris. Shout-out to David, of course. His idea about integrating local artists really made the book interesting. Team Epic, right? Have we decided when to present the prototype to the community? How about next Thursday? That gives us enough time to finalize it. Sounds like a plan. We'll have to submit it for approval by end of day Tuesday at the latest. I'll make sure to coordinate with the necessary departments. You know, it's funny how alarmed everyone got when tech stocks dropped a bit last week. I wouldn't understand too complex for you. It's not that complex, Chris. In essence, we're talking about the stock value of technology. They fluctuate based on various factors. So why were people panicking? It's investor-centric. It's a fragile thing. You remember how in March last year, the slumping tech shares rattled the markets? I do recall that. Plus, there's a lot of uncertainty. You're right. Pandemic uncertainty still lingers, and the situation in the Middle East is volatile. Adds up to a perfect storm for markets. But it's not all doom and gloom. Speaking of perfect storm, how do you think this is going to affect the upcoming IPO? Honestly, it'll depend. Each company will have its unique situation. Some might delay their IPOs, and others might choose to go ahead. There's something about this Zynga technology, right? Yes, the one I mentioned last time? Getting ready to go public and work on edge computing technology? Great. Oh, was that the tech brokered by the Arclight Consortium? Yes, that's the one. Laura from Arclight seemed quite pumped about it. But they're just in their pre-IPO phase, right? Yeah, but they're in a really good position. I have a feeling that despite the general mood, they could surpass expectations. What do you mean by surpass expectations? That means the initial share offering might end up being priced higher than what's currently expected. So you're saying people who invest early might have a good chance of making it popular? Chris, you're turning into a savvy investor. But yes, particularly because Zynga is poised to make a substantial announcement regarding a breakthrough in their technology, and that'll shoot up their value. I'd hold my horses till the news actually comes out. But yeah, I get your point. Julia, it's always good to get insiders' viewpoints. Speaking of art, isn't your magazine featuring an interview with that hotshot street artist next month, Chris? You bet. Stencil Smith is his name. I really love his work. Stencil Smith? He's quite a hook. And he's as intriguing as his name, believe me. Would you believe he was a software engineer before he took up street art? Whoa, really? Why'd he switch? I guess he got fed up with the nine to five statement and wanted to follow his passion. Plus, street art has a good potential to monetize. It did. That's pretty great. Not everyone leaves their secure job to follow their passions. Well, I like banking too much, to be honest. But honestly, the thrill of Wall Street and all the deals, it's got its own charm. Oh, Alex, only you can turn cooking into an awards industry. I know, right? Let me tell you about that time when I tried baking a cake. Julia, so what's next for your company? Any big news on the horizon? Well, we are working on expanding our AI platform. Theoretically, it should be able to draft legal papers with minimal human intervention. That's huge. It is, but there's still a long way to go. Alex, what about you? Any big mergers or acquisitions you should be aware of? Now, now that's confidential information. It was a great list. Let's catch up at Julia's VR demo next week. Sounds good to me. Good afternoon, guys. I've been thinking a lot about our investment in Horizon Tech. I've got news from inside the company that they're about to acquire a significant, well established company in their industry. That's interesting, Alice. Any idea who they're acquiring? I'm not quite certain yet, though I've heard through the grapevine that it might be X-Kernel Enterprise, a major player in software development. That would be huge. X-Kernel is looking for a buyout, too. Their innovative approach to AI-driven algorithms could be valuable to third parties. It certainly sounds promising. However, be prepared for every outcome. We should know how it would affect our positioning regarding this company. From a financial standpoint, it's looking good. I've analyzed the fiscal impact, and our shares could increase in value substantially if the acquisition goes through as expected. That is prospective. Let's investigate this more before we decide our next step. Do you have any info about when this announcement might become valid? My source tells me that it will be announced in two weeks. That gives us enough time to figure things out. Right. Let's keep this confidential for now. We need to obtain more concrete evidence. About our meeting next week with the Green Energy folks, I've developed our presentation, covering all the points we previously discussed. Great camera. Let's revisit our talking points once we finish looking into Horizon Tech and X-Kernel. What about our digital marketing initiative? I've noticed our engagement rate has been dropping too. I didn't mean to bring that up. Before we divert our attention to that, let's finalize our plans for Horizon Tech. Agreed. Let's tie up loose ends and move systematically. Well, how's everyone's morning been so far? I think I had too much coffee all day. But other than that, great. Can't complain. Just another manic Monday. I made the band. Fruitful, I say the least. Had an early call with a new client overseas. Sounds productive. Getting right into it, eh? So, any plans for the weekend? I'm planning a hiking trip to Herriman State Park. I'm just taking a step back for now. That sounds lovely. I'll be wrapping up a campaign for a client. Hopefully, I'll get a quiet Sunday. Good luck with that, Rachel. What about you, Mark? Might head upstate. And yes, aside from that, I'm vetting a new investment for the firm. Oh, interesting. What's the sector? Clean Energy. You wouldn't believe the advances. This one firm, named Green Sun, they're on the brink of something substantial. Oh, I've heard of them. Aren't they developing some breakthrough, super-efficient solar panel technology or something? Yes, correct. There are rumors, and I underline rumors, that they're about to get some big federal funding too. That's refreshing, eco-friendly technology getting the limelight. It's only more investors like you champion sustainability. Don't give me too much credit. It's not cherry. It's about turning a profit. This sector is genuinely promising. Anyway, guys, I think it's time for me to do some actual work. Those bar charts won't analyze the results, unfortunately. I've got an inbox waiting for me. Let's do this again next week? Sounds like a plan. Same time, same place. Absolutely. But maybe less coffee for me next time. So, I see I'm not the only one using this coffee spot as an office. Makes me feel less guilty about hogging this table. Yeah, it's become a phenomenon, hasn't it? Why pay rent when you've got cafes with free Wi-Fi? Just a cup of coffee and you're set for the day. Don't forget about paying for coffee every hour, or else you get the blares of death from investors. They're just ensuring their business model works. Can't blame them. Peter, you mentioned you teach yoga, right? That's fascinating. I wouldn't have guessed. Well, you take one look at Simon in his suit, and it's easy to peg him as a corporate type. Me? I guess I'm a wild card. Point taken. I'd venture to assert that it'd be fascinating to delve into everyone's career here. I'm in. But I warn you, budget analysis isn't as glamorous as fashion design or venture capitalism. You make a valid point, Joan. But without proper financial planning, none of our endeavors would survive. I've always wondered, Simon, as someone who deals with new business ideas every day, what makes an idea fun to work with? That's an insightful question. It's not just the idea, it's the people behind it. I invest in individuals as much as their concepts. I look for passion, a clear vision, and a willingness to adapt. So basically, budding entrepreneurs need to project that they're as flexible and balanced as, say, a yoga instructor. I see what you did there, Joan. But yes, yoga is all about adapting to change and finding balance. Just like fashion, trends come and go. Adaptation is the means of change. Exactly. It seems like our fields aren't too different, after all. Joan, what's the most challenging aspect of budget analysis you face? Maybe this is supposed to be a light conversation, but let me see. I guess it's maintaining precise accuracy at all times. A tiny mistake can snowball into major financial complications. Sort of like missing a stitch and having the whole design unravel. Exactly. And you, Simon, what's your biggest challenge when you do research? Spotting the difference between genuinely passionate entrepreneurs and those merely seeking to make some extra money. Sometimes the difference isn't too clear, but it's there. Learning to read people's true intention for it, that's an art now, Simon. And speaking of art, I think we all desperately need some meditation to keep us balanced in our crazy professions. Anyone interested? Wow, these fancy coffee places never cease to shock me. I mean, how much is too much for a latte? Well, I guess it depends on how you value your morning coffee, I guess, doesn't it? True, Penny. One person's luxury could be another person's necessity. But still, I think it offers a good opportunity to talk about finance. I couldn't agree more, Sarah. I think we've learned quite a lot from each other. So, as you all know, I'm a bit of a risk taker. Recently, I've started day trading. My belief is that if you understand the market dynamics, you can make some big gains. Day trading, really? Isn't that rather risky, Ben? I've heard of so many people losing all their savings for doing it. Investment isn't my strongest suit, I confess. I've been more into real estate than financial. Solid, tangible balance. You know, high risk, high return. Grace. That's my world view. In Diego, it's not so different. Real estate involves fluctuations like a stock market. Well, as a mother of two, with one income in the family, I've been very particular about saving my kids' futures. We've got small investments, but mostly in conservative portfolios. Also, after my divorce, it became important to me to invest in real estate. It was a significant shift from sharing everything to being entirely responsible for my own life. It must be challenging, Grace. Has anyone here considered a financial advisor? I think it might be a good decision for you. Matter of fact, I've been thinking about it, too. It's one thing to chase high returns, and another to manage things in a sensible way. You've been working with a financial advisor, actually. She's been so helpful in navigating all of this, making important decisions, and looking at the future. Perhaps we should all have another meet-up for that discussion. I have a lot to share about it, too. But I need to head back to my shop. Work was rough today. Tell me about it. I thought Mrs. Johnson would never answer that. You should have seen how carried he's not at all. I swear, one of these days, he's going to fall right out of his chair. Speaking of falling, some must have gotten into Simmons. He was acting really awkward. Ah, yes, Simmons, the erratic. Maybe he's got a secret stash of spirits in his chest. No, seriously. You should have seen him during our meeting. He looked like he was all dirty. Maybe he had a hint of the quarterly results before the meeting? That could be it. But I wonder what made him look so clear. I guess we'll find out soon enough. By the way, did you guys hear about the Oriental Bank deal? Yeah, something about them becoming partners, right? Exactly. And there is a rumor that the deal didn't go smoothly. Gulps down his coffee with some good stuff. That is supposed to be confidential, though. Sorry, lads. I thought we knew about that. Someone is definitely going to hear from HR. Another rushed morning, another hurried cup of coffee and a paper cup. I know what you mean. There's something comforting about having your coffee made by someone else. True, it tastes better when someone else makes it. Or is it just the lack of effort that seems refreshing? I'd say it's both. By the way, how's Mike doing? Have you heard about his dog? Yeah, I heard about Chuck. I felt so sad on hearing about him. Mike seemed completely heartbroken. It's amazing how losing a pet feels like losing a family member. We're not just talking about a dog, we're talking about a bond, a relationship. I know, Sam. I still remember when I had to put down my cat, Whiskers. That grief was heart-wrenching. Have you ever thought about getting another pet? I have been thinking of adopting an older cat, but I am just not sure if I am ready yet. You know what? Let's talk about something more cheerful. Agreed. So, did you end up going to that concert last weekend? Ah, yeah. The jazz concert. It was phenomenal. You know, there's something about live music. I agree. The energy, the vibes, it's an altogether different environment. Yes, and the rawness, the improvisation, it feels real. It was indeed a pleasant break from our monotonous life. Makes me wonder why we don't take such breaks more often. Well, it often gets down to time and money, doesn't it? True. Anyway, heard any good book recommendations lately? Yes. My neighbor lent me this book called Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens. It's a beautiful tale about a girl growing up alone in the marshes of North Carolina. Sounds intriguing. I will put it on my reading list. Did you start reading it already? Actually, yes. I've just gotten through the first couple of chapters. It's beautifully written, and I am loving the character development. Nice. I'm eager to start it now, too.
